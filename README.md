# Hi There! I'm Aiden, a New Grad from Sheridan College ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a Software Developer Looking to Start My Career ðŸ‘€

- ðŸŒ± In December 2023 I graduated from Sheridan College's Computer System Technician - Software Development and Network Engineering program.
- ðŸ›  There I learned the basics of Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS) as well as working with both backend (Springboot, ASP.NET, ExpressJS) and frontend (Angular, jQuery) frameworks.

## How I Got My Start 
I started learning programming in 2015 with Java making text-based and JavaFX apps. I still remember the mantra of all beginner Java programmers: 'public static void main string args'.
